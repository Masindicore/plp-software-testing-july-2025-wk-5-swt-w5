##  Section 1: Role Overview

**Role Summary:**  
As the Test Executor, my role involved executing all approved test cases, capturing actual results, documenting evidence, and logging any observed defects on GitHub Issues.  
I validated both functional and risk-based test cases focusing on:
- Game logic  
- Leaderboard behavior  
- Reset functionality  
- Hint mechanism  

My goal was to ensure that the application met acceptance criteria and user expectations through structured manual testing and visual verification.

### Risk Analysis Impact:
The risk-based approach fundamentally shaped our testing strategy, enabling:
- **Efficient resource allocation** (60% effort on high-priority risks)
- **Early defect detection** in critical areas
- **Focused test design** on business-critical functionality
- **Proactive mitigation** of potential failure points

### Team Communication Effectiveness:

**Strengths:**
- Clear role definitions prevented overlap and gaps
- Regular stand-ups enabled quick issue resolution
- GitHub provided transparent workflow visibility
- Collaborative test case reviews improved quality

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Earlier involvement in requirement analysis could have prevented some UX issues
- More frequent cross-role pairing would have enhanced knowledge sharing
- Automated metric tracking could have reduced manual reporting overhead

### Improvements for Next Cycle:
1. **Earlier Risk Identification** - Involve QA during feature specification
2. **Enhanced Automation** - Implement basic test automation for regression suites
3. **Improved Metrics** - Develop real-time dashboard for test monitoring
4. **Expanded Mobile Testing** - Allocate dedicated resources for responsive design validation
5. **User Acceptance Integration** - Include limited UAT parallel to system testing
